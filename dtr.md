# Guiding Questions 

## For this initial exploration into what you bring to a team, try to avoid thinking about your technical skills. Your answers to these questions should apply to any project/team that you work on:


**1. How would you describe your preferred working style?**
I like collaborating with partners to bounce ideas off each other, even just for homework. 

**2. What strengths do you bring to a team?**
I work well with others and know how to communicate my needs. 

**3. Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous group project settings? What can you do to either ensure those best practices carry over into projects here or to avoid common pitfalls that might come up?**
Time management has gone poorly in the past, but I've also had lots of success with strong presentations and clear communication. 

**4. How do you prefer to handle disagreements that come up? (Yes, they will come up!)**
Coming to a middle ground, or just trying both people's ideas and not choosing one over the other. 

**5. How do you communicate best? What tools do you need to communicate well with your teammates?**
I communicate best verbally and through text based communication. To communicate well with my teammates, we all need patience and a willingness to admit we were wrong or need help.

**6. How do you prefer to receive feedback? How do you prefer to give feedback?**
I prefer giving and receiving gentle feedback. 

**7. What scheduling constraints do you have? What are your preferred work times outside of normal school hours?**
I'm not typically available before class hours for mod 1, and for mod 0 I'm not available before 11am any given day.
